Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Servings: 24

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water

1. Mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 cup warm water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
7. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.
11. Cover wok with lid and steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
