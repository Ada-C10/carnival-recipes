Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------


1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
6. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts.
7. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.
9. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
